# Post Course – Java Project

### Overview

Using your knowledge of Java, and the importance of testing your code, we would like you to build (and test!) a calculator in Java.

### Goals

- Tested Application: All features should be tested, and these tests should be written
  before the code.
- A DRY application: Whilst you have built a calculator before in JS, this is your chance to build one “properly and efficiently”. Pay particular attention to code that is being repeated and could be made into a method to ensure this application is as tight as possible.

### Specifications

The calculator should use a Scanner to take input from the user, and perform the following operations…

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication & division
- Chained operations (e.g. 5 + 17 \* 3)
- Numbers squared and square rooted
- Ability to handle negative numbers
- Ability to handle decimal numbers
